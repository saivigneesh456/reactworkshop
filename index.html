   <p> "Last Gasp" is the fourth episode of the first series of the <b>British black comedy anthology television programme Inside No. 9</b> . It first aired on 26 February 2014 on BBC Two <hr>. Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the story revolves around the birthday of
     the severely ill Tamsin—played by <hr> Lucy Hutchinson—whose parents 
     rrange for the singer Frankie J Parsons (David Bedella) to visit their daughter
      through the charity WishmakerUK. Frankie dies after blowing up a balloon, leading to arguments 
      between Tamsin's father (Pemberton), <br>the WishmakerUK representative Sally (Tamsin Greig, pictured), 
      and Frankie's assistant Si (Adam Deacon) over the now-valuable balloon containing Frankie's last breath. The story was inspired by someone Pemberton had seen on Swap Shop who collected air from different places. The episode is a morality tale that satirizes and critiques celebrity culture. Pemberton subsequently sold a balloon containing his breath on eBay, with proceeds going to a Sport Relief charity.
